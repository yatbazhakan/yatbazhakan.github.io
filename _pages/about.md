I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Autonomous Systems at Queen’s University Belfast. My research focuses on safe and resilient artificial intelligence for intelligent transport, with an emphasis on run-time monitoring, introspection, and uncertainty quantification in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. I am particularly interested in developing mechanisms that ensure reliability of perception modules under adverse or uncertain conditions. I welcome collaborations on topics related to safe AI for autonomous vehicles and beyond—please feel free to get in touch.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at WMG, University of Warwick, where I worked on EU-funded projects (EVENTS, Hi-Drive) to design and integrate self-assessment frameworks into real-world automated driving pipelines. I completed my PhD in Engineering at Warwick, supervised by Prof. Mehrdad Dianati and Dr. Roger Woodman, with a thesis on run-time monitoring of perception in automated driving systems.

I hold a master’s and bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Middle East Technical University (Northern Cyprus Campus). During this time, I also contributed to international projects on e-health, IoT, and wireless sensor networks, with outcomes published in IEEE and ACM journals.
